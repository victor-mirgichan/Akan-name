                <h1>AKAN NAMING SYTEM</h1>
                <P>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. </P>
                <P>Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. </P>
                <P>This web application will takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. </P>
